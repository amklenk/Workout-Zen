# Workout-Zen

## Description

This project was created for a person who is new to working out so that they can learn how to workout certain muscle groups, in a low-stress environment, and get fit.
The contributors are:

- Colin Alexander
- Amanda Klenk
- Hannah Nicks
- Mtende Roll

The following are the requirements set by the contributors:
- When the user visits the application, they will see a motivation quote and buttons with each muscle group listed.
- When the user clicks a muscle group button, the exercise list will show exercises that target that muscle group.
- When the user clicks on an exercise, they will be redirected to a page that shows the details of that exercise.
  The project creation had additional requirements. The site needed to:
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Installation

The repository, Workout-Zen, was created and cloned from GitHub. An index.html file and an exercise.html file were created and coded to contain the site content and the individual exercise content. A folder, assets, was created to house three folders: css, images, and js. The css folder contains the style sheets, style.css and exerstyle.css, which was created and coded to contain the site formatting and design for the index page and the exercise page, respectively. The images folder contains an image of the logo, the background image, and a screenshot of the live site. The js folder contains the script sheets, quote.js and workout.js, which was created and coded to allow the site to be dynamic. The file quote.js fetches and renders the motivational quotes. The file workout.js fetches and renders the exercise data.

  The site is navagable via the muscle group buttons (to display the exercise list), the exercises within the exercise list (to redirect to the exercise page and render the data), the go back button on the exercise page (to redirect the user back to the index page), the favorites button(NOT SURE ABOUT THIS YET), and the submit button (NOT SURE HERE EITHER).

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. The pictures will be replaced with YouTube videos. More exercises will be added to each button and more buttons will be added to the website so the user can access all of the API features. Another update we will be adding is a search button for our users to search for specific workouts. Additional information will be added to each exercise description to provide clearer instructions as to how specific workouts are done.
